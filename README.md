# Machine-Learning-Project
The dataset we used can be found from Kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data.

In this project, we have tried to build a convolutional neural network that will help to predict the correct digit with good accuracy. This is a work in progress. We are working on to build a CNN that will help to correctly identify a mathematical equation.
